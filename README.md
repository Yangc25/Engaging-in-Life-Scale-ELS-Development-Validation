## Overview
This repository provides the R analysis pipeline for the development and validation of the **Engaging in Life Scale (ELS)**.  
The project includes three analytic stages:

1. **Stage 1:** Item analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)  
2. **Stage 2:** Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT), and validity testing (long form)  
3. **Stage 3:** Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) short-form selection and validation  

The pipeline is fully reproducible using open-source R packages and follows standard psychometric development procedures.
